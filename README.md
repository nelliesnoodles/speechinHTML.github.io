## Adding a text to audio speech with JavaScript

### about this experiment
I was attempting to use an (any!) API to get the html to give me back text into audio/speech.  
NOTHING worked until I found this link:
[kungfoo.net](http://cr.kungfoo.net/speech/immediately-speak.html)

Here's the home to the link, explaining Google chrome blocks this API.
